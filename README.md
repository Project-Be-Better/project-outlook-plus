# Outlook++

Outlook++ is an enhanced, modern desktop productivity suite inspired by Microsoft Outlook, built with Electron and TypeScript.  
The goal is to create a modular, extensible, and cross-platform app for email, calendar, contacts, and more—with features and UX improvements over the classic Outlook experience.

- Unified inbox for multiple accounts
- Calendar and scheduling
- Contacts management
- Smart search and filtering

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Electron main process

```bash
npx tsc -p apps/electron
```

### 3. Run the Electron app

```bash
npx electron ./apps/dist-electron/main.js
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Keep Electron main/preload code separate from frontend code.
- Plan for shared packages (types, utils, UI) as the project grows.
- Use environment variables and `.env` files for configuration.
- Follow security best practices (e.g., use a preload script, avoid enabling `nodeIntegration` in the renderer).
